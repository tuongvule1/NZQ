# NZQ
Header files for data structure that handle arbitrarily large numbers (limited by memory space only).  
The N data structure represents nonnegative integers.  
The Z data structure represents all integers.  
The Q data structure represents rational numbers.  
Oprators such as +,-,*,/,^ are implemented. Rationals numbers can be printed in various ways - repeating decimal representations, or simply decimal with certain precision, or the fraction form.  
See the main.cpp file for some example use.
